SageMath is one of the well designed approaches to blur the boundaries 
among being a user, developer and contributor in the open-source 
ecosystem. Probably I will be hanging around for a long time be it 
bugging, complaining, documenting, adding content and eventually 
digging into source codes ;)

From my point of view SageMath definitely has *not* failed! I would not be able to do the computations I need
for my research on any other platform at this point (of course this could be possibly done, but with an enormous
effort). More and more people are interested in switching to SageMath at least people with a focus in
combinatorics, representation theory, root systems, .... and are offering to organize SageMath Days to learn
and start using and contributing to SageMath. In fact, we just concluded SageMath Days in India and there were
people interested in a variety of topics. From this point of view, SageMath has gone far beyond any other
mathematical software system I know!

After typing in "ode_solve", the tab- 
completion guided me to the class "ode_solver", which also works like 
a charm.  This is the reason for my late reply: I was so glad to get 
everything working that I lost all track of time... <br/>
I know this is not the place for a panegyric on SageMath, but I've been 
playing around with SageMath for only a week and it is amazing.  I'm 
behind on all my work while I'm redoing all my code in SageMath, and I 
even wrote a small differential forms package, all in one week :)

SAGE is a work of art! It has very clean syntax, extremely well
documented and the coding is very clean. An average python programmer
like myself could create new functions in SAGE. I've always wanted
something like MATLAB but the price tag is a bit well ... pricey for a
12 year old. SAGE fits the bill perfectly. Thank you so much for SAGE!

      I&#39;m working on modeling the efficacy of a hypothetical infectious vaccine (like the live
      polio vaccine). I have lots of small coding chunks that makes the sage notebook great for
      working through each section of the problem. SageMath including Sop and networkx has eliminated a
      lot of the tedium I would have had to churn through otherwise, while native plotting allows
      easy visualization.<br />
      An earlier implementation in Mathematica 6.0 was orders of magnitude slower for a simpler
      simulation. While neither implementation was optimized, my first pass in Python/SageMath was much
      more effective, and easier to write and understand.

      SageMath brought me back to using linux, perhaps permanently this time.  
     I only use windows for games these days.  I actually haven't used SageMath very much recently.  
    I'm doing stock trading strategies and I was using R.  But every time I left R for a while and came back, 
    it seemed like i had to relearn it over again.  SageMath helped me to see how much simpler just doing it in python is, 
   and I find that I only really need numpy and matplotlib with pyplot for what I'm doing, 
   mostly simple calculations on stock data.  Although it's nice to know SageMath is there if I need it.

      The model I am reimplementing and extending was written in a dialect of BASIC, QuickBASIC I
      think, in the late 80s and carefully backed up onto now-unreadable 5 1/4&quot; floppies.
      After playing around with writing the program in Scilab, I reviewed my methodology and
      realised I wanted to have something that is more reproducable in the future with regards test
      runs and results. NetCDF support is available with Python. Rather than building my own Python
      development environment I remembered a colleague had talked about SageMath. The model need to
      write as well as read NetCDF files, so I am building NetCDF and pycdf packages for SageMath.

      In my opinion, SAGE&#39;s notebook is the real killer feature, which I don&#39;t recall to
      have seen in any other (commercial or not) software. I mean, this is the only scientific
      program that I&#39;ve found, allowing such an easy collaborative job within local networks,
      something that is not comparable to any kind of subversioning software or stuff like that.
      The only idea that I can access my data from abroad (if needed) by setting up a SAGE server
      makes me happy. Moreover, the nice interface is valuable as well, like the presentation of
      results in latex format.<br />
      I know that interfaces are not really scientists&#39; job, but having a good one is a real
      step ahead. And plot interactivity is a one million dollar feature for people who deal with
      design and system performance evaluation.

      In teaching:<br />
      I used SAGE for some sections of a differential equations course I was teaching last fall.
      Wasn&#39;t sure if the students would just &quot;take the hit&quot; and refuse to learn SAGE
      so I made the assignments worth very little and very easy. Also, I made extra assignments for
      extra credit.<br />
      It turned out not only did most do the assignment but a lot more than I expected did the
      extra credit ones too and say that they liked SAGE and its philosophy.<br />
      I would call it a success in teaching.<br />
      <br />
      In research:<br />
      I wrote some time ago a procedure for computing Duursma zeta functions of a linear
      error-correcting code. AFAIK, no other program does this (not GUAVA nor MAGMA, ...). These
      zeta functions are very similar to the zeta function of a curve (they have a functional
      equation, a &quot;Riemann hypothesis&quot;, etc), except that no one knows why the
      &quot;Riemann hypothesis&quot; doesn&#39;t always hold. There is a conjecture that it holds
      for a certain &quot;extremal&quot; class of codes, so maybe the RH holds for &quot;good&quot;
      or &quot;optimal&quot; codes (since optimal codes are sometimes extremal)?<br />
      A year or 2 ago, I found an example of a formally self-dual with optimal parameters which
      violates the RH.<br />
      I would call that a success in research.

      Why SageMath is useful for me.<br />
      <br />
      I have a program that I do for my master thesis, it&#39;s some finite elements method +
      electronic structure calculations [on] some very fast Solaris boxes. I just remember I gave
      up installing scipy+umfpack on some old Debian boxes in Munich, so I just installed SageMath
      instead. — [If one] of the aims of SageMath is to be a viable alternative to Matlab, so
      that&#39;s about it.<br />
      SageMath Solaris port +1!<br />
      <br />
      [Maybe] I&#39;ll be teaching some undergrad calculus stuff in a year or two and so I was
      thinking which programs I&#39;d use and the constraint will probably be Windows.<br />
      Installing python+sympy in Windows is not convenient — it&#39;s about 10 clicks with mouse
      and it installs somewhere to C:\Python2.5 by default and I don&#39;t understand Windows much
      but I just get the feeling that it messes up with the registry as well and I don&#39;t like
      this at all.<br />
      So, SageMath Windows port +1 as well!

      Project:<br />
      Computation of cohomology rings of finite p-groups with coefficients in GF(p)<br />
      How SageMath and its components were used:

      <ul>
       <li>I use Gap to compute certain elementary abelian subgroups.</li>

       <li>Due to Cython, i can use C-programs of David Green for computing minimal
       resolutions.</li>

       <li>Cython is a very nice python-like programming language, in which I created classes for
       cochains, chain maps, cohomology rings etc.</li>

       <li>In order to find a minimal generating set and a minimal set of relations for a
       cohomology ring, i need Gröbner Basis computations in graded commutative rings (or simply
       &quot;commutative&quot;, in characteristic 2); Singular does that job.</li>
      </ul>Success story:

      <ul>
       <li>The Z/2 cohomology rings of all 267 groups of order 64 were known before, but with other
       software required a computation time of several days. Our programs based on SageMath only need
       45 minutes on a 2.3 GHz CPU.</li>

       <li>Previously, the computation of the Z/2 cohomology rings of the 2328 groups of order 128
       was out of reach. With our programs, a complete computation was possible. It took about two
       months of computation time on 4 CPUs with 2 GHz.</li>

       <li>We present our results (also including all but 9 groups of order 243 and one group of
       order 1024) <a href="http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~king/cohomology/">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>General and personal experience:

      <ul>
       <li>After learning a few days, wrapping the C-programs was surprisingly easy.</li>

       <li>Writing Cython-code is fun!</li>

       <li>Communication with Singular via an ASCII interface was painful until i found some tricks
       to reduce the traffic.</li>

       <li>When problems occurred, the SageMath community was very responsive (Thank you!)</li>

      Hi. There is a simple saying: ““If you can count to ten you can count to infinity really” to
      motivate six year olds. Let’s now move on by motivating all ages using SAGE. I just give

      1. After counting we learn our youngsters to use &quot;*&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;.
      Not always easy to find motivating exercises. The following question proved to be fun for

      longer, e.g. bus trip et cetera.<br />
      a. Easy start. Take the for instance the numbers 3,5,7,8. The challenge is: make as many
      numbers as possible (i) starting from 0, (ii) you may use each number only once, and (iii)
      using the three operands &quot;*&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;.<br />
      The amazing fact is that you can produce consecutive numbers in the range 0..65. The
      following output comes from a SAGE notebook: 1 = 3+5-7 , 2 = 3+7-8 , 3 = 3 , 4 = 3+8-7 , 5 =
      5 , 6 = 3+8-5 , 7 = 7 , 8 = 8 , 9 = 3+5-7+8 , [...]<br />
      b. Less easy. Is 3,5,7,8 the best 4-tuple? Two ways to answer this using SAGE:<br />
      i. All (reasonable) combinations of 4 different numbers<br />
      ii. Hard: Prove it by (a) produce symbolic expressions – there are many! – and (b) just try
      to solve them.<br />
      c. You can play around by also allowing other operands like “/”, “^”, “mod or % in SAGE”, or
      you can allow also negative numbers and look for the longest consecutive row. In the case of
      3,5,7,8 and the three operands &quot;*&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot; I found 94
      consecutive numbers.<br />
      d. If you add “^” (so 2^3=8), you find that the 4-tuple 2,3,7,8 delivers a nice row of
      numbers 0..75 as the following SAGE output shows:<br />
      1 = 2**3-7 , 2 = 2 , 3 = 3 , 4 = 2+3+7-8 , 5 = 2*3+7-8 , 6 = 2*3 , 7 = 7 , 8 = 8 , 9 =
      2**3-7+8 , [...]<br />
      e. Allowing negative numbers, I found that 103 consecutive numbers can be produced. Such an
      exercise proved to be fun with motivated adults and some good drinks.<br />
      2. Playing around with four number is relatively easy. More difficult is the 5-tuple
      question, even in the simple case by only allowing the operands
      &quot;*&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;. The reason is mainly because the number of
      possibilities ‘explodes’.<br />
      To conclude: SAGE helped me to find relative simple exercises and questions to motivate
      people of all ages (i) to do exercises “using pen and paper”, and (ii) to become aware of the
      depth of even simple mathematics. I learned from SAGE that “mathematics on a computer is even
      better then gaming”.

      The Good:<br />
      I believe I already made it clear which are the things SageMath excels at, but a short summing up
      would be in order at this point. First, it&#39;s a completely capable IDE that can help you
      in various ways; secondly, it has an intuitive interface and, last but certainly not least,
      it comes with a well written documentation.<br />
      <br />
      The Bad:<br />
      Other than the fact that its most advanced functions are truly inaccessible to someone who
      doesn&#39;t have the right academic background, I didn&#39;t find anything not to my liking.
      May I remind you that I tried as best as I could to view this software from the perspective
      of someone who had at least a general idea of the matter.

      Math Geek Software Smackdown: SageMath v. Mathematica<br />
      A movement is afoot among some mathematicians in academia to make the switch from expensive,
      closed-source calculation software to free, open-source alternatives.<br />
      [I]n [William] Stein&#39;s eyes, [...] [t]ransparency is essential in the peer review process
      for new theorems, and since most of the major math programs are closed source, there&#39;s no
      way for researchers to study the code used to get a result. Open-source software makes that
      process totally transparent.

      One aspect of SageMath I find particularly intriguing is the &quot;notebook&quot; interface,
      which runs in a web browser. Factoring a polynomial feels just like shopping at Amazon.
      Moreover, the interface is exactly the same whether the browser is connected to a locally
      installed copy of SageMath or to a remote server. (There&#39;s a public SageMath server at <a href=
      "http://www.sagenb.org/">www.sagenb.org</a>). This is surely the way of the future.

      I actually really felt positive about this whole example as I really learned a lot more.
      [...] The more that I worked in [S]age the more comfortable I felt as well. The geographic
      projection issue is still there, as well as some indexing speed issues, but overall, I was
      really impressed with the Sage/SciPy/NumPy experience today.<br />
      Overall I feel that more of a transition was made for me last night/today. Which was great
