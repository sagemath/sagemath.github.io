<div class="narrow">
<b>Volker Braun</b> is a key contributor to all aspects of
SageMath development, contributing code and reviews for core mathematical
functions and providing technical improvements to the build system and
code maintenance.  He has quickly become a central figure in the SageMath
development community.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
In his four years of involvement, Volker has moved from contributing
code for cohomology of toric varieties to being the current release
manager.  Along the way, he has greatly improved the integration of
GAP with libGAP, created and distributed virtual machine versions of
SageMath and the SageMath notebook, managed much of the transition to git
version control over the past nine months, and made numerous
improvements to doctesting, the build system and overall code
maintenance.  He has fixed many difficult bugs, while also being a
generous reviewer.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
In recognition of his important and sustained contributions across all
aspects of SageMath development, Volker Braun is awarded the 2014 Spies
SageMath Development Prize.  This award carries a prize of $500 from the
SageMath Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies)
</div>

<h2 class="narrow">2013 Spies Prize: Jeroen Demeyer</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<b>Jeroen Demeyer</b> has provided excellent service to the SageMath community as
release manager, starting with Version 4.6.1 in January 2011, just
five months after his first code contribution.  He has continued to
contribute significant code to the SageMath library in the area of number
theory, including over forty contributions related to the fundamental
SageMath package of PARI.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
Jeroen is everything the SageMath community could ask for in a release
manager.  He is a trusted custodian of the code and has built an
impressive system for frequent beta and final releases.  He works
carefully with developers and users to balance the priorities of
fast-paced cutting-edge development, backwards compatibility,
portability, and high-quality software.  During his tenure as release
manager, he has earned great respect while making difficult decisions
as he shaped the SageMath that the world sees.  His efficient, timely,
fair and knowledgeable work has won him the admiration of the SageMath
development community and has rendered a great service to the much
larger user community.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his conscientious and technically excellent work as SageMath release
manager, and his significant contributions to the SageMath library, Jeroen
Demeyer is awarded the 2013 Spies Prize.
</div>

<h2 class="narrow">2012 Spies Prize: Jason Grout</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<strong>Jason Grout</strong> is a constant presence across the
SageMath landscape.  He is extremely active in the discussion groups, comments on
many tickets, contributes code to the core SageMath library, improves the
documentation, and works tirelessly to improve the notebook interface.  He
contributes in many ways to make SageMath a better tool for mathematics
research, but he is perhaps most recognized for his efforts to make
SageMath an effective tool for teaching mathematics.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
Jason's mathematical tastes have resulted in major code contributions
for linear algebra, graph theory, plotting and symbolics.  These are
all important areas for the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  But
he is equally interested in SageMath infrastructure, such as LaTeX
representation, usability improvements to Trac server, format and
delivery of documentation, and NumPy/SciPy integration.  With a strong
background in web applications, his work on the notebook interface is
both visionary and technically strong.  A recent project he runs is
the SageMath Cell Server, which allows a remote server to accept SageMath code
and return results without any account or login.  This can power
interactive demonstrations on web pages or computations via mobile
devices, and the principles and implementations will be used in
increasing the scalability of SageMath servers.  As an example of his
interest in education, this project has involved several undergraduate
students in significant ways.  Jason also gives freely of his time to
help other users and developers.  He is the second most numerous
poster of all time in the sage-support forum, in the top five for the
sage-devel, sage-edu and sage-notebook forums, and he has the
fifth-highest karma at the Ask SageMath site.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his significant and inspiring technical contributions, his massive
contributions to the vitality of the SageMath community, his work on
making SageMath available via the notebook and cell servers, and his
interest in education, Jason Grout is awarded the 2012 Spies SageMath
Development Prize. This award carries a prize of $500 from the SageMath
Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies).
</div>

<h2 class="narrow">2011 Spies Prize: Robert Bradshaw</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<strong>Robert Bradshaw</strong> has been an extremely active and productive SageMath
developer for over five years.  Additionally, he has been a leader,
both in maintaining the community and in important design decisions.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
He is probably best known for his work on Cython, which is critical for
the performance of many key parts of SageMath, and his work designing and
implementing the coercion model, which makes many powerful
mathematical constructions possible. However, his interests and
significant contributions are wide-ranging, including: exact linear
algebra, arithmetic of elliptic curves, L-functions, 3-D plotting and
parallel building.  A recent project is the patchbot tool, which
automates testing contributions posted on trac.  Moreover, he is an
important contributor to trouble-shooting and design discussions in
the sage-devel forum and is also the third most numerous poster of all
time in the sage-support forum.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his many important technical contributions, and his long-time and
continuing involvement in the SageMath community, Robert Bradshaw is
awarded the 2011 Spies SageMath Development Prize.  This award carries a prize
of $500 from the SageMath Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies).
