background in web applications, his work on the notebook interface is
both visionary and technically strong.  A recent project he runs is
the SageMath Cell Server, which allows a remote server to accept SageMath code
and return results without any account or login.  This can power
interactive demonstrations on web pages or computations via mobile
devices, and the principles and implementations will be used in
increasing the scalability of SageMath servers.  As an example of his
interest in education, this project has involved several undergraduate
students in significant ways.  Jason also gives freely of his time to
help other users and developers.  He is the second most numerous
poster of all time in the sage-support forum, in the top five for the
sage-devel, sage-edu and sage-notebook forums, and he has the
fifth-highest karma at the Ask SageMath site.
