  <p>
  So far we have looked at derivatives outside of the notion of differentiability.
  The problem with this approach, though, is that some functions have one or many
  points or intervals where their derivatives are undefined. A function f is 
  <strong>differentiable</strong> at a point c if
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability01.png" /> exists.
  </div>
  <p>
  Similarly, f is differentiable on an open interval (a, b) if
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability01.png" /> exists for every c in (a, b).
  </div>
  <p>
  Basically, f is differentiable at c if f'(c) is defined, by the above definition.
  Another point of note is that if f is differentiable at c, then f is continuous
  at c.
  </p>
  <p>
  Let's go through a few examples and discuss their differentiability. First,
  consider the following function.
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability02.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot(1/x^2, x, -5, 5).show(ymin=0, ymax=10)
</pre>
  <a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  To find the limit of the function's slope when the change in x is 0, we can
  either use the true definition of the derivative and do
  </p>
<pre class="tutcode">
def f(x):
    return 1/x^2

var('h')
((f(x+h)-f(x))/h).rational_simplify().subs(h=0)
</pre>
  <a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  or we can simply use the rules of differentiation by calling 'derivative(1/x^2, x)'.
  In any case, we find that
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability03.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Since f'(x) is undefined when x = 0 (-2/0<sup>2</sup> = ?), we say that f is
  not differentiable at x = 0. Since f'(x) is defined for every other x, we can
  say that f' is continuous on (-&infin;, 0) U (0, &infin;), where "U" denotes
  the union of two intervals.
  </p>
  <p>
  How about a function that is everywhere continuous but <em>is not</em> everywhere
  differentiable? This occurs quite often with piecewise functions, since even
  though two intervals might be connected, the slope can change radically at their
  junction. Take a look at the function g(x) = |x|.
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability04.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
plot(abs(x), x, -5, 5)
</pre>
  <a class="tuttoggle" href="javascript:calctut.toggle(1);">Toggle Explanation</a> <a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p class="tutexplain" id="explain1">
  1) Plot the absolute value of x from -5 to 5.
  </p>
  <p>
  Using our knowledge of what "absolute value" means, we can rewrite g(x) in the
  expanded form
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability05.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  This should be easy to differentiate now; we get
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability06.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  What about at x = 0? The "logical" response would be to see that g(0) = 0 and
  say that g'(0) must therefore equal 0. Careful, though...looking back at the
  limit definition of the derivative, the derivative of f at a point c is the
  <em>limit</em> of the slope of f as the change in its independent variable
  approaches 0. Really, the only relevant piece of information is the behavior of
  function's slope <em>close to c</em>. Referring back to the example, since the
  limit of g'(x) as x approaches 0 from the left &ne; the limit of g'(x) as x
  approaches 0 from the right, g'(0) does not exist. We can use the limit definition
  of the derivative to prove this:
  </p>
  <div class="proof" style="line-height:500%">
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability07.png" />
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability08.png" />
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability09.png" />
  <img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability10.png" />,&nbsp;
  so&nbsp;<img class="vmiddle" src="calctut-pix/differentiability11.png" />,&nbsp;
  which is undefined.
  </div>
  <p>
  In this form, it makes far more sense why g'(0) is undefined. By simply looking
  at the graph of g, too, one can see that the sudden "twist" at x = 0 is responsible
  for our inability to evaluate g' there. We can now justly pronounce that g
  is differentiable on (-&infin;, 0) U (0, &infin;), so g' is continuous on that
  same interval.
  </p>
  <p>
  The third function of discussion has a couple of quirks--take a look.
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability12.png" />
  </div>
<pre class="tutcode">
p = plot(sqrt(x-2), x, 2, 5)
pt1 = point((3, 1), rgbcolor="white", pointsize=30, faceted=True)
pt2 = point((3, 2), rgbcolor="black", pointsize=30)
l = line([(3, 1), (3, 2)], linestyle="--")
(p+pt1+pt2+l).show(xmin=0)
</pre>

  <p>
  Not only is v(t) defined solely on [2, &infin;), it has a jump discontinuity
  at t = 3. The jump discontinuity causes v'(t) to be undefined at t = 3; do you
  see why? Using a slightly modified limit definition of the derivative, think of
  what
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability13.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  would be for c = 3 and some x very close to 3. The resulting slope would be
  astronomically large either negatively or positively, right? In fact, the dashed
  line connecting v(t) for t &ne; 3 and v(3) is what the tangent line will look
  like at that point. Since a function's derivative cannot be infinitely large
  and still be considered to "exist" at that point, v is not differentiable at t=3.
  </p>
  <h2>The Mean Value Theorem</h2>
  <p>
  The Mean Value Theorem is very important for the discussion of derivatives; even
  though it might seem somewhat obvious, it is actually very important to many
  other concepts in calculus. We'll start with an example.
  </p>
  <p>
  Consider the vast, seemingly endless state of Montana. Now, pretend that you
  are driving across Montana so that you can get to Washington, and you want to
  do so as quickly as possible. The problem, however, is that the signs posted
  every few miles explicitly state that the speed limit is 70 miles per hour.
  "Oh well," you tell yourself. "When I'm on the open road, I will go as fast as
  I want. When I approach a town, though, I will slow down so that the police are
  none the wiser."
  </p>
  <p>
  Since you had been staying with some relatives in the town of Springdale, you
  first head east at the brisk pace of 90 miles per hour until, feeling your stomach
  rumble (you really aren't cut out for these long drives), you stop in Livingston
  for some lunch. When you arrive, however, a policeman signals you to pull over!
  "What did I do wrong?" you sweetly ask the officer. Giving you a hard look, the
  policeman responds, "Though I didn't <em>actually</em> see you speeding at any
  point on your way here, I know that you must have, since one of my buddies back
  in Livingston tells me that you left there only 10 minutes ago, and our two towns
  are about 15 miles apart. I won't cite you for it this time, but you'd better
  drive slower in the future."
  </p>
  <p>
  The question is: How did the policeman know you had been speeding? Well, since
  it took you 10 minutes to travel 15 miles, your average speed was 90 miles per
  hour. So either you traveled at exactly 90 miles per hour the entire time, or
  you traveled at more than 90 part of the way and less than ninety part of the
  way. In either case, you were going faster than the speed limit at some point
  in time.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <strong>Mean Value Theorem</strong> has a very similar message: if a function
  f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and is differentiable on the open
  interval (a, b), then there is some c in (a, b) such that
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability14.png" />
  </div>
  <p>
  Basically, the average slope of f between a and b will equal the actual slope
  of f at some point between a and b. To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem,
  consider the function f(x) = x*sin(x) for x in [0, 9&pi;/2]. Assume that f is
  differentiable on (0, 9&pi;/2) (it is) and continuous on [0, 9&pi;/2] (it is).
  By the Mean Value Theorem, there is at least one c in (0, 9&pi;/2) such that
  </p>
  <div class="proof">
  <img src="calctut-pix/differentiability15.png" />.
  </div>
  <p>
  And such a c does exist, in fact. You can use SageMath's solve function to verify
  this:
<pre class="tutcode">
solve(derivative(x*sin(x), x) == 0, x)
</pre>
  <a class="lines" href="javascript:calctut.toggleLineNumbers();">Toggle Line Numbers</a>
  <p>
  From the code's output, you can see that this is true whenever -sin(x)/cos(x)
  is 0. Thus c = 0, &pi;, 2&pi;, 3&pi;, and 4&pi;, so the Mean Value Theorem is
  satisfied for f on the interval [0, 9&pi;/2].
  </p>
  <h2>Rolle's Theorem</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Rolle's Theorem</strong> states that if a function g is differentiable
  on (a, b), continuous [a, b], and g(a) = g(b), then there is at least one number
  c in (a, b) such that g'(c) = 0. To see this, consider the everywhere differentiable
  and everywhere continuous function g(x) = (x-3)*(x+2)*(x^2+4). To prove that
  g' has at least one zero for x in (-&infin;, &infin;), notice that g(3) = g(-2)
  = 0. By Rolle's Theorem, there must be at least one c in (-2, 3) such that g'(c)
  = 0.
