* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bug fixes

 * Sage now uses Python 2.6.x
 * Support for building Singular with GCC 4.4
 * Optimized integer division
 * Combinatorics: irreducible matrix representations of symmetric groups;
   Yang-Baxter Graphs
 * Cryptography: Mini Advanced Encryption Standard for educational purposes

   free R-modules; multiplicative order for matrices over finite fields
 * Miscellaneous: optimized Sudoku solver; a decorator for declaring
   abstract methods; support Unicode in LaTeX cells (notebook)
