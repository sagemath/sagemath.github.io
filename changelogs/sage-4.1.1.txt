For all the details of what else changed in Sage 4.1.1, please see the
release tour on the Sage wiki at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-4.1.1


* Bug Statistics

We closed 165 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.1.1

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.


* Upcoming Release

The upcoming release is Sage 4.1.2. This will be a bug-fix release. We
also intend to merge as many features as possible.


* Doctesting Coverage

Ticket #877 changes the way the docstring coverage is
counted. Previously, the docstring coverage script also counted functions
that are local to other functions. In this manner, the docstring
coverage for Sage 4.1 is:

Overall weighted coverage score:  77.8%
Total number of functions:  22398

With ticket #877, nested functions or functions local to other
functions are no longer counted towards the docstring coverage. This
results in a reduced number of functions, hence we have the following
statistics as a result of #877:

Overall weighted coverage score:  78.3%
Total number of functions:  22210

Using the docstring coverage technique from ticket #877, in 4.1.1 we
increased coverage by 0.3%, while adding 120 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score: 78.6%
Total number of functions: 22330


* Known issues

The standard package cliquer doesn't build under some 64-bit
platforms. There are reports of cliquer failing to compile under 64-bit
Fedora 10 (see ticket #6746) and 64-bit Intel Mac running OS X 10.5
(see ticket #6681). We provide the 64-bit binary

sage-4.1.1-OSX10.5-intel-64bit-i386-Darwin.dmg

However, users should note that the README.txt file in that binary
contains a warning about cliquer. In the above binary, the cliquer
import statement in sage/graphs/all.py has been commented
out like so

#from sage.graphs.cliquer import *

as a work-around to allow Sage to start up. In the meantime, users
won't have access to functionalities of the cliquer spkg until ticket
#6681 has been resolved.
