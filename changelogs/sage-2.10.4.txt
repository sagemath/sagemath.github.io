Hello folks,

Sage 2.10.4 has been released on March 17th, 2008. It is available at

           http://sagemath.org/download.html

* About Sage (http://www.sagemath.org)

Sage is developed by volunteers and combines 71 open source packages.
It is available for download from sagemath.org and its mirrors in
source or binary form. If you have any questions and/or problems
please report them to the google groups sage-devel, sage-support,
You can also drop by in #sage-devel or #sage-support infreenode.

We have closed the Google Groups sage-newbie and sage-forum so 
that we can deal with support questions in sage-support only. We 
decided to close those two groups since we had various inquiries 
left unanswered due to people posting to the wrong group.

* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

This 

 * Memory leaks exposed by modular symbols: Michael Abshoff, 
   Martin Albrecht, Burcin Erocal, Willem Jan Palenstijn, 
   Clement Pernet, William Stein: memory leaks exposed by 
   modular symbols functionality. This ticket is a composite 
   of numerous other memleak fixes merged over a *7 month* 
   period. Modular forms are an excellent way to expose 
   memory leaks in pretty much every algebraic component 
   of Sage and all known issues there are now finally fixed.

 * SQLAlchemy and DSage: We merged SetupTools and SQLAlchemy 
   into Sage as standard packages. SQLAlchemy is now used as 
   in DSage replacing hand written code with much more 
   efficient classes from SQLAlchemy. SetupTools is required 
   to install SQLAlchemy, but is also useful for a number of 
   experimental spkgs like Mayavi2, TVTK and other packages
   from the Enthought Tool Suite. Yi Qiang improved DSage 
   making it more robust and finally adding the documentation 
   to the standard Sage manual. 

 * Graph theory: chromatic polynomial: An algorithm originally 
   written in C by Gordon Royle has been adapted by Robert 
   Miller to replace the old slow method. This algorithm 
   uses a cut and merge algorithm to recursively compute 
   the chromatic polynomial, and is written in Cython.

 * Documentation: Many doctest patches written during Doc 
   Day 2 were merged. In addition many people kept up the 
   good work after Doc Day 2 was over and have been 
   submitting patches to increase coverage. We did exceed 
   the target for the release by 0.6% reaching 47.6%.

 * Symmetric function updates: Mike Hansen, reviewed by 
   Franco Saliola: Sage 2.10.4 adds support for Macdonald 
   polynomials, LLT polynomials, and Jack polynomials as 
   well as a whole class of user-defined symmetric functions 
   which can characterized by orthogonality and triangularity 
   conditions. Support for working with ribbon tableaux was 
   also added as part of these updates. In addition, many
   doctests were added and subtle bugs fixed.

 * Notebook Updates Tom Boothby and William Stein and 
   Timothy Clemans: Fixed a bunch of new and old issue that 
   improve the usability of the notebook. Among those are 
   a working trash, fixes to the polling infrastructure, 
   saving the content of unevaluated cells, URL issues to 
   work around problems introduced by restrictive firewalls
   and small improvements to the interact command.

 * Parallel Doctesting: Gary Furnish reviewed by Michael 
   Abshoff: "sage -tp" has been introduced as an experimental 
   multithreaded doctester. The first parameter is the number 
   of threads, and the second parameter is the folder to 
   doctest. Thus "sage -tp 4 devel/sage/sage" tests everything 
   with four threads running. Additional options like "-long" 
   or valgrind options like "-memcheck" do work. The code base 
   is still young and needs more testing. The eventual goal 
   will be to replace the current doctesting infrastructure 
   with this code base.

 * SBox Class: Martin Albrecht introduced a new S-box class 
   to Sage to support (algebraic) exploration of this 
   fundamental cryptographic primitive.

* Known Issues with 2.10.4:

 * None

* Bug Statistics

We closed 89 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.10.4

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 2.11, chaired by Michael Abshoff. 
The release is planned in about two weeks. Potential features 
(which are also the goals for 3.0) include:

 * Upgrade many core components of Sage: Python 2.5.2, 
   ATLAS 3.8.1, clisp 2.44.1
 * 50% doctest coverage
 * OSX 10.5 support in 64 bit mode [this will depend on fixing
   a vexing segfault in libSingular and getting disutils to
   play nice with numpy]
 * Pexpect interace to R

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.10.3 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  44.5%
Total number of functions:  18640

We increased coverage by 3.1% in 2.10.4 while removing 24 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  47.6%
Total number of functions:  18616
