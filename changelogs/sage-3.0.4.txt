  http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.0.4

* Known Issues with 3.0.4:

 * RHEL 5 clisp build issue: the latest clisp.spkg does not build 
   so please use the clisp.spkg from Sage 3.0.3.

* Bug Statistics

We closed 131 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.0.4

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 3.0.5, chaired by Michael Abshoff. It will 
focus on getting optional packages to work well and fix some of the 
remaining blockers left over from 3.0.4. This will be the ISSAC 
release, so we should really make this a good one.
