* Major features, new spkgs and bug fixes

 * Many improvements in the build system.
 * Major new features in the Sage notebook server.
 * Numerous new features in the combinatorics module, including a 
   feature-rich category implementation inspired by Axiom.
 * Many improvements in the graph theory module, both the backend
   implementation and new features.
 * 15 package updates.


For all the details of what else changed in Sage 4.3, please see the
release tour on the Sage wiki at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-4.3


* Bug Statistics

We closed 237 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.3

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.


* Doctesting Coverage

In Sage 4.2.1, the overall weighted coverage score was 79.8% and the
total number of functions was 22,835. For Sage 4.3, we increase doctest
coverage by 1% with 928 new functions. The overall weighted coverage
score is now 80.8% with a total of 23,763 functions.


* Known issues

 * Compiling Sage from source on Arch Linux may require some manual
   intervention.
 * There is yet no support for building Sage on openSUSE 11.2. The
   compilation fails at the point when building the sqlite spkg.
 * Sage is not yet fully supported on Mac OS X 10.6. One could compile
   Sage on that platform, but a doctest would result in many "abort
   trap" errors. See ticket #7095 at
   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7095
