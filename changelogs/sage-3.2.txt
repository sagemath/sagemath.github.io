* Known Issues with 3.2:

 * RHEL 5 clisp build issue: the latest clisp.spkg does not build 
   so please use the clisp.spkg from Sage 3.0.3.

* Bug Statistics

We closed 183 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.2

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement.
