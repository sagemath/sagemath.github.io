or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.4.1, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
81.7%, with 25,475 functions. In Sage 4.4.2, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.4% and added 38 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.4.2 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  82.1%
 * Total number of functions:  25,513

* Known issues

On 32-bit systems, there are random segfaults in doctests of
planarity.pyx. This issue is tracked at ticket #8756.
