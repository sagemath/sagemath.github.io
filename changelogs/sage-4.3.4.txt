* Major features, new spkg's, and bug fixes

 * Merged 16 tickets enhancing the combinatorics module. A big thank
   you to the Sage-Combinat team for their hard work before and during
   Sage Days 20 to get those tickets merged.
 * Sage now builds on SPARC Solaris 10, in particular on the machine
   t2.math.washington.edu. A big thank you to David Kirkby for his
   consistent hard work to get Sage to build on that machine. Please also
   thank Jaap Spies and John Palmieri for their work on getting Sage to
   build on t2.math.
 * New spkg: iconv-1.13.1
 * Removed spkg: pyprocessing-0.52.p0
 * Upgraded spkg's: ecl-10.2.1, mpfr-2.4.2, mpmath-0.14,
   sagenb-0.7.5.3, sqlalchemy-0.5.8, sqlite-3.6.22, twisted-9.0.p2
 * Updated spkg's: atlas-3.8.3.p12, cddlib-094f.p5,
   eclib-20080310.p10, flint-1.5.0.p4, python-2.6.4.p7, r-2.10.1.p0,
   sagetex-2.2.3.p0, scipy-0.7.p4, zn_poly-0.9.p3

* Bug statistics

We closed 120 tickets. For details see

  http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.3.4

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Upcoming release

The upcoming major release is Sage 5.0, scheduled to be released in
early June 2010. The goals for Sage 5.0 include:

 * Resolve the high-impact tickets at
   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/stab1
 * Raise the doctest coverage score to 90% by removing the notebook
   from the score and writing about 1500 docstrings
 * Official 32-bit Solaris 10 support on SPARC (automatic build, all
   tests pass)
 * Official Cygwin support (automatic build, all tests pass)

* Doctesting coverage

To my dismay, this release of Sage actually has a decrease in doctest
coverage. For Sage 4.3.3, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage
score of 81.6%, with 24,808 functions. In Sage 4.3.4, we decreased the
doctest coverage by 0.1% and added 314 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.3.4
we now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.5%
 * Total number of functions:  25,122

* Known issues

 * Kiran Kedlaya reported that Sage can fail to compile on 64-bit
   Fedora 10. This build problem occurs after we added the new iconv
   spkg.
