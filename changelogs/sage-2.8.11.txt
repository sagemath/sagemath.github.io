Sage 2.8.11:

Release team: Michael Abshoff (chair), William Stein, Carl Witty

While there were many bug fixes, performance improvements and features added 
the main goal of this release was to get Sage building out of the box in 32 
bit mode on OSX 10.5. We didn't make it 100% to the finish line, but more 
about that below. The main participants in the port were William Stein, 
Ralf-Philipp Weinmann and Michael Abshoff. If you plan to participate in 
Sage Bug Day 5 you should build this release since it will be the base we 
build upon.

This release contains patches and updated spkgs from (in ascending order 
of ticket number):

* Jaap Spies
* Carl Witty
* Tom Boothby
* William Stein
* Martin Albrecht
* Josh Kantor
* Ondrej Certik
* Michael Abshoff
* Joel Mohler
* Mike Hansen
* Jennifer S. Balakrishnan
* Jason Grout
* Robert Bradshaw
* Ralf-Philipp Weinmann

Build instruction for OSX 10.5

Install gfortran (e.g., binaries from http://sagemath.org/packages/binary/gfortran/
or http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ and export SAGE_FORTRAN=`which gfortran`. 
Then the build will work. 
There is one more doctest to fix and I am certain that this will be done
quickly. If you do not install gfortran Sage will use the prebuilt 
g95 which will fail to compile scipy on 10.5. Please report any issues you 
encounter.  

Apologies to anybody I might have forgotten.

Cheers,

Michael
