* Upcoming release

Sage 5.0?

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.3.5, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
81.5%, with 25122 functions. In Sage 4.4, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.2% and added 276 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.4 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.7%
 * Total number of functions:  25406

* Known issues

#8749: BSD: doctest failures on solaris (t2): doctest failures,
Solaris only, probably due to a combination of a timeout and some
buggy code related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

#8756: random segfault in planarity.pyx test: occasional doctest
failures due to segfaults on some 32-bit linux boxes.
