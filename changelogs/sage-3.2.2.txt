[Unfortunately due to a bug that slipped by in testing we never announced this build publicly, 
so this is merely for the record]


Hello folks,

* Known Issues with 3.2.2:

 * RHEL 5 clisp build issue: the latest clisp.spkg does not build 
   so please use the clisp.spkg from Sage 3.0.3.

* Bug Statistics

We closed 105 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.2.2

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 3.2.3, chaired by Michael Abshoff. It will 
be a release focusing on merging existing patches from trac in 
preparation for the big docstring Sphinx conversion planned for Sage 3.3. 
The release cycle will be on the short side, i.e. about 7 days are 
planned.

* Doctesting Coverage

For 3.2.1 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  63.3%
Total number of functions:  21617

We increased coverage by 0.9% in 3.2.2 while adding 417 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  64.2%
Total number of functions:  22034
