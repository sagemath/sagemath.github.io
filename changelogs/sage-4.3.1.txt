Release Managers

 * Mike Hansen
 * Robert Miller


* Major features, new spkgs and bug fixes

 * Substantial work towards a nearly complete SPARC Solaris 10
   port. This is due to the hard work of David Kirkby.
 * We're moving closer towards a FreeBSD port, thanks to the work of
   Peter Jeremy.

For all the details of what else changed in Sage 4.3.1, please see the
release tour on the Sage wiki at

* Bug Statistics

We closed 193 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.3.1

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.


* Upcoming Release

The upcoming release is Sage 4.3.2, planned to be release in time for
Sage Days 20 in Marseille, France, from February 22 to February 26,
2010. For more information on Sage Days 20, see its official website

  http://www.lirmm.fr/arith/wiki/MathInfo2010/SageDays

or the Sage wiki page

* Doctesting Coverage

For Sage 4.3, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
80.8%, with 23,763 functions. In Sage 4.3.1, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.5% and added 634 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.3.1 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.3%
 * Total number of functions:  24397


* Known issues

Sage 4.3.1 was planned to be a release in which Sage would build
successfully on SPARC Solaris 10, especially on the machine

  t2.math.washington.edu

During development, a ticket was merged that prevented a successful
build on that platform. We are tracking this issue at ticket #7932.

Building the reference manual can result in some errors due to a bad
docstring formatting. We are tracking this issue at ticket #8021.

Fortran is now a pre-requisite for building Sage on Linux. During
compilation on Linux, you might receive the following error message:

  Error installing Fortran: You must install gfortran or set
  SAGE_FORTRAN (and possibly SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB).

If so, then you need to first install Fortran using your Linux
distribution's package manager. After that, you can resume building
Sage.

Merged in sage-4.3.1.alpha1:

No tickets were merged in sage-4.3.1.alpha1. In Sage 4.3.1.alpha0,
there are two PolyBori packages under SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard:

* polybori-0.6.3-20090827.spkg
* polybori-0.6.3.r1647-20091028.spkg

The only difference between Sage 4.3.1.alpha1 and Sage 4.3.1.alpha0 is
as follows. The package polybori-0.6.3-20090827.spkg is removed in
Sage 4.3.1.alpha1. And the package polybori-0.6.3.r1647-20091028.spkg
is replaced with polybori-0.6.3-20090827.spkg. Both
polybori-0.6.3.r1647-20091028.spkg and polybori-0.6.3-20090827.spkg
are the same version of PolyBori, the only difference is that
polybori-0.6.3-20090827.spkg follows naming convention for spkg's.
