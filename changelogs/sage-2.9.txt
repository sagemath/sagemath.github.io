* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

We achieved most of the goals we set ourselves for 2.9. The major
changes compared to 2.8.15 are:

 * Integration of PolyBoRi
 * Integration of ATLAS BLAS/Lapack on non-OSX
 * Integration of R 2.6.1 and rpy
 * Update to FLINT 1.02
 * Update to Symmetrica 2.0
 * Much faster permutation arithmetic
 * Very fast rubik's cube solvers
 * Many build fixes applied and many bugs squashed

We closed a total of 110 tickets, for details see below or our 
tracker at

http://www.sagetrac.org/sage_trac/query?status=closed&milestone=sage-2.9

* Known Issues with 2.9

#1137: Import gd fails to import on OSX 10.4 ppc. Any attempt 
       to fix this breaks other applications on different OSX 
       flavors. We hope to fix this in 2.9.1.
#1497: ATLAS fails to build on FC7, Dual core [known ATLAS 
       issue with workaround: disable power management] 

* Upcoming Releases

The following releases are planned for the rest of the year:

 * 2.9.1: chaired by Robert Miller, bug fixes, release 
          planned about a week from now
 * 2.9.2: chaired by Michael Abshoff, bug fixes, release 
          planned about two weeks from now

2.9.2 will be the release we plan to distribute on DVD at the AMS 
meeting, so we are shooting hard for an excellent release.

* Doctesting Coverage 

For 2.9:

Overall weighted coverage score:  35.3%
Total number of functions:  17947

Compared to 2.8.15 this is an increase by 0.5%.
