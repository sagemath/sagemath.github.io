* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

Singular was updated to the latest 3-0-4 release. But neither PolyBoRi
nor ATLAS made it into the final release. But the vast majority of the
prep work needed to make ATLAS a standard spkg was finally done in
this release cycle. PolyBoRi will probably become an optional spkg
first until all the details have been worked out.
