* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

The focus of Sage Days 12 in San Diego sponsored by CCR West was to 
fix as many open bugs in Sage as possible and it proved to be a great 
success by closing about a third of the known defects in Sage within 
a five day period. The final status report can be found at 

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/days12/statusreports?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=report.pdf

We also updated various Sage components with known security issues, 
so please update if you run a Sage server, especially if it is exposed 
to the public net.

Aside from the above there a are very large number of improvements as 
well as updates to the components of Sage. One of the new major usability 
improvements to the notebook is the addition and integration of the 
TinyMCE editor which now allows to add inline text cells to the notebook 
via a very nice WYSIWYG editor. This was made possible by Jason Grout 
who while working on this ticket did also clean up the way Sage's other 
Javascript based components were installed and used. 

For all the details of what else changed in Sage 3.3 please see the release 
tour in the Sage wiki at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.3

* Known Issues with 3.3:

 * RHEL 5 clisp build issue: the latest clisp.spkg does not build 
   so please use the clisp.spkg from Sage 3.0.3.
 * On Fedora Core 9 and 10 system Sage can fail at startup due
   to "out of memory" conditions related to libSingular.  These
   failures are due to a bug in the Fedora kernel's new security
   features that interacts poorly with libSingular's memory
   allocation system. It also seems to be much more easily triggered
   on 64 bit platforms.  The bug indeed was first detected about 9
   months ago, but we hoped that the kernel would be fixed; we have
   decided to fix the problem on the Singular side, instead, but
   have not yet completed the fix.
 * If you upgrade please delete the old matplotlibrc from  $DOT_SAGE, 
   $SAGE_ROOT, and $SAGE_ROOT/tmp since they cause deprecation warnings
   when doctesting or using certain functionality. These are false 
   positives and caused by the outdated matplotlibrc we used to ship.

* Bug Statistics

We closed a record 385 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.3

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

 * Sage 3.4 will focus on two major features: The ReST transition of the 
   documentation in Sage spearheaded by Mike Hansen and the merging of Jon 
   Hanke's quadratic forms library code into the main Sage library. This 
   code will play a central role at Sage Days 13 that will take place 
   from February 28th until March 2nd 2009 at the  University of Georgia, 
   Athens. This implies that this release will be made in the next 4 days.
 * Sage 3.4.1 will merge code from the coding sprint of SD 13 as well as 
   fixes for the usual bugs that will crop up. This release ought to be 
   out two or three days after the end of SD 13 and is meant to stabilize 
   the 3.4 series due to the large amount of code that went into the 3.3 
   and 3.4 release cycles.
 * Sage 3.4.2 should contain additional bug fixes and maybe even more code 
   for quadratic forms to get ready for the Arizona Winterschool 2009 which 
   takes place during the middle of March. There will be many Sage developers 
   and users there, so this ought to be an interesting workshop. 

* Doctesting Coverage

For 3.2.3 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  64.3%
Total number of functions:  21982

We increased coverage by 0.7% in 3.3 while adding 247 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  65.0%
Total number of functions:  22229
