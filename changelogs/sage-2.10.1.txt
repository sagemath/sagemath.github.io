* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

 * Updated to eclib.spkg from cremona.spkg. 
 * Update to FLINT 1.0.6
 * Updated to MPFR 2.3.1 which contains an important fix that 
   avoids smashing the stack with large precisions
 * Improved ATLAS with pre-tuned settings for more CPUs. This 
   greatly reduced the compile time on Pentium M and Athlon CPUS. 
 * Massive improvements on the doctesting coverage.
 * Fix security issue with the notebook (found by T. Clemans). 
   It is *highly* recommended that you upgrade.
 * Fixed various memleaks in PolyBoRi. There are still some 
   issues in the PolyBoRi wrapper.
 * Progress on the Solaris port as well as the 64-bit OS X port. 
   Neither port is yet ready for prime time.

* Known Issues with 2.10.1:

 * GNUTLS might fail to build on OS X if guile is present. For a 
   workaround use the updated GNUTLS spkg linked from ticket #2003
 * You need to update the optional valgrind.spkg to the 3.3.0 
   release because the interface has been changed in 2.10.1 and it
   isn't backward compatible with earlier releases.

* Bug Statistics

We closed 186 tickets. For details see

    http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.10.1

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 2.10.2, chaired by Michael Abshoff. The release
is planned post Sage Days 7, but details are sketchy at the moment. 
Potential features include:

 * David Roe's unramified and Eisenstein extensions of Qp and Zp 
 * John Voight's code for enumerating totally real fields [with 
   generalizations for not-totally real fields]
 * OS X 10.5 support in 64-bit mode [this will depend on fixing
   a vexing segfault in libSingular and getting disutils to
   play nice with numpy]
 * GCC 4.3 support out of the box
 * FreeBSD support out of the box
 * Michael Abshoff's improved experimental Solaris support
 * William Stein's rewrite of the mwrank Cython interface

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.10 we had:
Overall weighted coverage score:  35.4%
Total number of functions:  18296

We increased coverage by 2.9% in 2.10.1 while removing 6 functions:
Overall weighted coverage score:  38.3%
Total number of functions:  18290
