Hello folks,

Sage 2.10.3 has been released on March 11th, 2008. It is available at

           http://sagemath.org/download.html

* About Sage (http://www.sagemath.org)

Sage is developed by volunteers and combines 71 open source packages.
It is available for download from sagemath.org and its mirrors in
source or binary form. If you have any questions and/or problems
please report them to the google groups sage-devel, sage-support,
You can also drop by in #sage-devel or #sage-support infreenode.

We have closed the Google Groups sage-newbie and sage-forum so 
that we can deal with support questions in sage-support only. We 
decided to close those two groups since we had various inquiries 
left unanswered due to people posting to the wrong group.

* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

 * Interactive Functions: Sage now has a first version of 
   its "interact" command. Calling "@interact" before 
   defining a function will construct controls to 
   graphically control the input variables of the function, 
   making it dramatically easier to create interactive 
   functionality that is easy to use. See 
   http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact for details and 
   examples or just type "interact?" in Sage.

 * Graph theory: Many of the results of Sage Days 7: 
   Combinatorics are included in this release, including 
   Schnyder's algorithm for producing straight-line drawings 
   of planar graphs in linear time (Jonathan Bober and Emily 
   Kirkman), and a new compiled backend for the base graph 
   structures (Robert Miller). This backend will be switched 
   into graphs proper in sage-2.10.4, and the basic functions, 
   such as add edge and has edge, will be sped up by at least 
   20 times in many cases, and often much more. In addition 
   most of graph.py was refactored and cleaned up, in 
   preparation for the switch.

 * Plotting: The plot_vector_field function now takes 
   2-variable functions, allowing for much more complex 
   vector fields.

 * Linear Algebra: Matrices now have a jordan_form method 
   which computes the Jordan canonical form.

 * Unified derivative syntax: The derivative function now 
   accepts the same argument format across many different 
   data types, including symbolic objects, polynomials, 
   power series, and Laurent series.

 * LinBox & Givaro updates: Clement Pernet did fix a large 
   number of issues in LinBox and Givaro in cooperation with 
   Michael Abshoff and we finally updated the code in Sage 
   to clean upstream code. While there are still issues left 
   we will do more work in that direction in 2.10.4 and 2.11.

* Known Issues with 2.10.3:

 * None

* Bug Statistics

We closed 152 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.10.3

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 2.10.4, chaired by Robert Miller and 
Michael Abshoff. The release is planned in about two weeks. 
Potential features (which is also the goal for 3.0) include:

 * 47% doctest coverage
 * OSX 10.5 support in 64 bit mode [this will depend on fixing
   a vexing segfault in libSingular and getting disutils to
   play nice with numpy]
 * Pexpect interface to R

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.10.2 we had:
Overall weighted coverage score:  40.1%
Total number of functions:  18528

We increased coverage by 4.4% in 2.10.3 while adding 112 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  44.5%
Total number of functions:  18640
