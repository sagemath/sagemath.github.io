His frustration with proprietary mathematical software was\nhis main motivation to create a viable open-source alternative. Just\nas Firefox is an alternative to Internet Explorer or OpenOffice.org is\nan alternative to Microsoft Office, {{ sage }} is a comprehensive open\nsource alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab.\n</div>\n<div class=\"txt narrow\">\n{{ sage }} consists of a collection of <a href=\"./links-components.html\">mathematical software</a>\nand a core library bundling the functionality of these components into one consistent experience.\nAdditionally to that it provides a framework to express mathematical calculations\nand a library of mathematical algorithms.\n</div>\n<div class=\"txt narrow\">\nMathematics is very old and encompasses many very different topics. \nIt is hard to come up with one unique approach that suites beginners as well as experts.\n{{ sage }} tries to solve this and \n<em>\"is doing remarkably well at keeping a balance between ease-of-use for beginners and high-end users.\"</em> \nas <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/38cb807fd76c59a1\">David Kohel once said</a>.\n</div>\n<div class=\"narrow\">\nRead more:\n<ul> \n<li><a href=\"./tour.html\">Tour</a>, <a href=\"./tour-benchmarks.html\">Benchmarks</a>,\n<a href=\"./tour-graphics.html\">some plots</a>;\n<a href=\"./library-why.html\">Why?</a>;
